AHB Field work data for the Clarksburg Poplar Plantation.


# 2014-11-09

Greenwood Resources preformed the first coppice event on the 9th and 10th.  Each truck from the harvested poplar was weighed, and samples were taken by Greenwood to obtain dry weight estimates for the harvest.  __The harvested poplar will be delivered to Zeachem?__

In association with Greenwood's coppice harvest, UCD did a LAI preliminary field test beforehand.  The intent was to gain some insight on the time it would take for more complete estimates for the following coppicing.  Two methods where employed, hemispherical images and use of the LI-COR LAI 2000 plant canopy analyzer.

In addition, we discussed with Greenwood a strategy were we build a field test strategy to be used on all AHB plantations in the following year.  UCD would work w/ Greenwood resources on staffing that position.
